# Cadmus TGR App

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.6.

üêã Quick Docker image build:

1. `npm run build-lib`;
2. update `env.js` version, and `ng build --configuration production`;
3. `docker build . -t vedph2020/cadmus-tgr-app:6.0.3 -t vedph2020/cadmus-tgr-app:latest` (replace with the current version).

Web application frontend for Cadmus _TGR_. This application is built by packing together a number of components:

- _frontend_: the app includes the application and its specific libraries; shared Cadmus libraries (as defined in [Cadmus shell](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus_shell)) are used from NPM.
- _backend_: the corresponding backend API is [Cadmus TGR API](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus_tgr_api), depending on [Cadmus TGR](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus_tgr) for its specific parts.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.1:

```bash
ng new cadmus-tgr-app --prefix cadmus
```

Each library is added like this:

```bash
ng generate library @myrmidon/cadmus-tgr-core --prefix tgr
```

## Production

(1) build as explained above (1-2).

(2) in the `dist` folder, edit the `env.js` file and replace the `localhost` server with the IP address of your API, e.g.:

```js
window.__env.apiUrl = "http://151.100.184.12:59590/api/";
```

Swagger at <http://151.100.184.12:59590/swagger/index.html>.

(note the API port number; the standard port 80/443 is reserved for this frontend).

(3) `docker build . -t vedph2020/cadmus-tgr-app:6.0.2-prod` and then push the image.

CORS Note: in `docker-compose.yml`, ensure that your web app IP is found in the `AllowedOrigins` of the API layer, e.g.:

```yml
- ALLOWEDORIGINS__0=http://90.147.166.176
```

## History

### 9.0.0

- 2025-01-30:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è migrated to signals.
  - updated Angular and packages.

- 2024-11-29: ‚ö†Ô∏è upgraded to Angular 19.
- 2024-06-10:
  - updated Angular and packages.
  - added `class="mat-X"` for each `color="X"` (e.g. `class="mat-primary"` wherever there is a `color="primary"`) to allow transitioning to Angular Material M3 from M2. This also implies adding it directly to the target element, so in the case of `mat-icon` inside a `button` with `color` the class is added to `mat-icon` directly (unless the button too has the same color). This allows to keep the old M2 clients while using the new M3, because it seems that the compatibility mixin is not effective in some cases like inheritance of `color`, and in the future `color` will be replaced by `class` altogether.
